# newquizapp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

1. Rename either the 'Basics Tutorial' or 'Concepts & Examples' file in lib to main.dart 
2. Uncomment the desired section of code you want to see. Make sure you follow these steps:
- All the imports uncommented
- And this line as well - void main() => runApp(MyApp());
3. Run the app using the command 'flutter run'
4. If you need to use other commands run 'flutter help' to give you a list of commands available.
